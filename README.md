# Modules used:

socket : module provides low-level networking functionality. It enables the creation of network sockets, which are endpoints for sending or receiving data across a computer network.

random : provides functions for generating random numbers. This is useful for scenarios where you need to introduce randomness or unpredictability.

string : contains various string-related functions, including character sets and string manipulation tools.

# Note:

This is a basic example and doesn't handle errors or implement more advanced features, but it demonstrates the use of socket, random, and string for a simple server client interaction.
